# QuickStart 1 - Install k0rdent prerequisites

The Quickstart installation has a couple of dependencies, so let‚Äôs get them installed before we start. 

## Install make

We‚Äôll be using Makefiles to execute a lot of these instructions, so make sure that you have make installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get install make
```

## Install Docker

Our k0rdent management cluster for this QuickStart will run on Kubernetes-in-Docker (KinD), so let‚Äôs go ahead and get Docker installed if you don‚Äôt have it already. You can find the full instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), but here‚Äôs the short version:

### First uninstall older, potentially conflicting versions:

```shell
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

### Use the Docker convenience script to deploy Docker:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

## Install kubectl

Our scripts will need the Kubernetes command line client. Full instructions for installing `kubectl` are [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/), but assuming you‚Äôre on an x86 machine, the basic instructions are:

```shell
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

## Install clusterawsadm

k0rdent uses Cluster API (CAPI) to marshal clouds and infrastructures. For AWS, this means using the components from the Cluster API Provider AWS (CAPA) project. This QuickStart leverages `clusterawsadm`, a CLI tool created by CAPA project that helps with AWS-specific tasks like IAM role, policy, and credential configuration. To install ```clusterawsadm``` on Ubuntu on x86 hardware:

```shell
curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/releases/download/v2.7.1/clusterawsadm-linux-amd64
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 clusterawsadm-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/clusterawsadm
```

## Install jq

You‚Äôll need the `jq` utility to process JSON from kubectl. Among other things, this helps you monitor steps in the installation process:

```shell
sudo apt install jq
```

## Clone the Getting Started repo
All the scripts required for our QuickStart and Tutorials are in the [Getting Started repo](https://github.com/k0rdent/demos) at https://github.com/k0rdent/demos. Let's clone that repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/k0rdent/demos
cd demos
```

# Create the management cluster

Now we‚Äôre ready to create the k0rdent management cluster. The makefile (in 2a-demos) does the work. Because we‚Äôre going to need to access Docker as root, let‚Äôs go ahead and change over to root:

```shell
sudo su
```

Now go ahead and bootstrap the management cluster using KinD:

```shell
make bootstrap-kind-cluster
```

If you want to specify a particular name for this cluster, you can include it in an environment variable called `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME`:

```shell
export KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=k0rdentdemo
sudo make bootstrap-kind-cluster
```

This command also sets up your `KUBECONFIG` and makes sure kubectl is pointing to the proper context:

```shell
No kind clusters found.
Creating cluster "hmc-management-local" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.31.2) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
Set kubectl context to "kind-hmc-management-local"
You can now use your cluster with:
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-hmc-management-local
Have a question, bug, or feature request? Let us know! https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/#community üôÇ
Switched to context "kind-hmc-management-local".
```

Once you see this output, you can confirm the cluster is running by issuing a kubectl command:

```shell
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE            NAME                                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

# Install k0rdent into the management cluster

You‚Äôre finally ready to install k0rdent!  Fortunately, that‚Äôs easy too:

```shell
make deploy-2a
```

The actual deployment can take 5 or 10 minutes, so you‚Äôll want to monitor the installation:

```shell
PATH=$PATH:./bin kubectl get management hmc -o go-template='{{range $key, $value := .status.components}}{{$key}}: {{if $value.success}}{{$value.success}}{{else}}{{$value.error}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

When k0rdent installation has succeeded, the output will look like this:


```shell
capi: true
cluster-api-provider-aws: true
cluster-api-provider-azure: true
cluster-api-provider-vsphere: true
hmc: true
k0smotron: true
projectsveltos: true
```

# Install the Getting Started Helm Repo into the management cluster

Helm charts for deploying the various Getting Started functions are in their own OCI repo, so let‚Äôs get that set up on the management cluster:

```shell
make setup-helmrepo
```

As you can see, this makefile deploys a local OCI Helm registry and adds a HelmRepository resource to the cluster so we can use it to deploy the various objects such as child clusters and templates:

```shell
deployment.apps/helm-registry created
persistentvolumeclaim/helm-registry-storage created
service/helm-registry created
helmrepository.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/2a-demos created
Now add the Helm charts with custom Cluster and Service Templates:
make push-helm-charts
```

Now all the pre-requisites are in place, we can move on to setting up to [deploy managed clusters on AWS](quickstart_2_aws_infra_setup.md).
